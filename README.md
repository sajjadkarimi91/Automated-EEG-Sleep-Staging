# Automated-EEG-Sleep-Staging

A MATLAB toolbox for EEG-based Sleep Stage Classification from preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, dimension reduction, and classification using SVM and KNN.

Codes and data for the following paper are extended to different methods:

Diffuse to fuse EEG spectraâ€“intrinsic geometry of sleep dynamics for classification.


## 1. Introduction.

This package includes the prototype MATLAB codes for Automated EEG Sleep Staging.

The implemented methodes include: 

  1. Various feature extraction methods, including 
     * Multiscale permutation entropy
     * Statistical features
     * AR coefficients
     * Spectrul entropy
     * Hjorth parameters mobility and complexity
     * Approximate entropy
     * Lyapunov exponent
     * Correlation dimension
     * Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients


  2. Several dimension reduction methods including PCA, LDA and TSNE
  3. Multiple classifiers SVM, KNN, NeuralNets
